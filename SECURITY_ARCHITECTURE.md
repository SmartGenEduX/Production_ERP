# SmartGenEduX - Security Architecture

## üîê Multi-Tenancy Security Model

### Architecture Choice: Application-Level Authorization

SmartGenEduX uses **Application-Level Authorization** (backend API filtering) instead of Database-Level Row-Level Security (RLS). Both are valid approaches for multi-tenancy, and this choice was deliberate for better flexibility and control.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Application-Level Authorization (Our Approach)

### How It Works

```
User Request
    ‚Üì
JWT Token Verification (includes schoolId)
    ‚Üì
Extract schoolId from token
    ‚Üì
Database Query with WHERE schoolId = ?
    ‚Üì
Return filtered results
```

### Implementation

#### 1. Authentication Middleware
```typescript
// server/routes.ts
export const authMiddleware = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace("Bearer ", "");
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
  
  req.user = {
    id: decoded.id,
    email: decoded.email,
    role: decoded.role,
    schoolId: decoded.schoolId  // ‚Üê Multi-tenancy isolation
  };
  
  next();
};
```

#### 2. Query Filtering
```typescript
// Every database query includes schoolId filter
app.get("/api/students", authMiddleware, async (req: any, res) => {
  const { schoolId } = req.user;  // ‚Üê From JWT token
  
  const students = await db.select()
    .from(students)
    .where(eq(students.schoolId, schoolId));  // ‚Üê Automatic filtering
  
  return res.json(students);
});
```

#### 3. All Tables Include schoolId
```typescript
// shared/schema.ts
export const students = pgTable("students", {
  id: varchar("id").primaryKey(),
  schoolId: varchar("school_id").notNull(),  // ‚Üê Multi-tenancy key
  // ... other fields
}, (t) => ({
  schoolIdx: index("school_idx").on(t.schoolId),  // ‚Üê Performance index
}));
```

## üÜö Application-Level vs Database RLS

### Application-Level Authorization (Our Choice)

**Advantages:**
‚úÖ **Full Control** - Complete control over authorization logic  
‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Easy to implement complex business rules  
‚úÖ **Framework Agnostic** - Works with any PostgreSQL provider  
‚úÖ **Debugging** - Easier to debug and test  
‚úÖ **Performance** - Predictable query patterns  
‚úÖ **Portability** - Not tied to specific database features  

**Trade-offs:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Developer Discipline** - Developers must remember to filter by schoolId  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No Database Enforcement** - Security is at application layer  

### Database RLS (Supabase Approach)

**Advantages:**
‚úÖ **Database Enforcement** - Security at database level  
‚úÖ **Defense in Depth** - Extra security layer  
‚úÖ **Automatic Filtering** - Database automatically filters rows  

**Trade-offs:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Vendor Lock-in** - Specific to PostgreSQL with RLS support  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Complexity** - More complex to debug and understand  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance** - Can be slower with complex policies  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Flexibility** - Harder to implement complex logic  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Security Measures

### 1. Strict Query Patterns
Every query MUST include schoolId filter:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always filter by schoolId
const data = await db.select()
  .from(table)
  .where(eq(table.schoolId, schoolId));

// ‚ùå WRONG - Missing schoolId filter (data leak!)
const data = await db.select()
  .from(table);
```

### 2. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does query include schoolId filter?
- [ ] Is schoolId from JWT token (not request body)?
- [ ] Are relationships properly filtered?
- [ ] Is Super Admin bypass intentional?

### 3. Automated Testing
```typescript
// Test multi-tenancy isolation
test("School A cannot see School B data", async () => {
  const school_a_token = generateToken({ schoolId: "school_a" });
  const school_b_token = generateToken({ schoolId: "school_b" });
  
  const response_a = await api.get("/api/students")
    .set("Authorization", `Bearer ${school_a_token}`);
  
  const response_b = await api.get("/api/students")
    .set("Authorization", `Bearer ${school_b_token}`);
  
  // Verify no overlap
  expect(response_a.body).not.toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({ schoolId: "school_b" }));
  expect(response_b.body).not.toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({ schoolId: "school_a" }));
});
```

### 4. Super Admin Override
Only Super Admin can access cross-school data:

```typescript
app.get("/api/all-schools-data", authMiddleware, async (req: any, res) => {
  const { role } = req.user;
  
  if (role !== 'super_admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Super Admin only" });
  }
  
  // Super Admin can see all data (no schoolId filter)
  const allData = await db.select().from(table);
  return res.json(allData);
});
```

---

## üìä Performance Optimization

### 1. Indexes
Every table with schoolId has an index:

```typescript
(t) => ({
  schoolIdx: index("school_idx").on(t.schoolId),
})
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast lookups: `WHERE school_id = ?`
- Efficient sorting
- Quick joins

### 2. Query Patterns
```typescript
// Efficient: Index used
SELECT * FROM students WHERE school_id = 'school_123';

// Efficient: Composite index
SELECT * FROM attendance 
WHERE school_id = 'school_123' 
  AND date = '2025-10-21';
```

## üîÑ Database Compatibility

### Works with ANY PostgreSQL Provider

Our application-level approach works with:
- ‚úÖ **Neon PostgreSQL** (Serverless - Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Supabase PostgreSQL** (With or without RLS)
- ‚úÖ **AWS RDS PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **Railway PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **Render PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ **Self-hosted PostgreSQL**

**Note about Supabase:**
- Our application works perfectly with Supabase PostgreSQL
- We DON'T use Supabase RLS policies
- We DON'T use Supabase Auth (we have our own JWT)
- We only use Supabase as a PostgreSQL provider
- This gives us maximum flexibility

---

## üéØ Why NOT Supabase RLS?

### Reasons for Application-Level Authorization

1. **Framework Independence**
   - Works with ANY PostgreSQL provider
   - Not locked into Supabase
   - Easy to migrate providers

2. **Flexibility**
   - Complex business rules easier to implement
   - Role-based access more flexible
   - Custom authorization logic

3. **Debugging**
   - Authorization logic in TypeScript (familiar)
   - Easy to log and trace
   - Better error messages

4. **Performance**
   - Predictable query execution
   - No RLS policy evaluation overhead
   - Simpler query plans

5. **Team Knowledge**
   - Most developers understand backend filtering
   - No need to learn RLS policy syntax
   - Standard PostgreSQL knowledge

## üß™ Testing Multi-Tenancy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
describe("Multi-Tenancy Isolation", () => {
  test("School A sees only their students", async () => {
    const token_a = generateToken({ schoolId: "school_a" });
    const students = await getStudents(token_a);
    
    students.forEach(student => {
      expect(student.schoolId).toBe("school_a");
    });
  });
  
  test("School B cannot access School A data", async () => {
    const token_b = generateToken({ schoolId: "school_b" });
    const school_a_student_id = "student_from_school_a";
    
    const response = await getStudent(token_b, school_a_student_id);
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(404); // Or 403
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
describe("Cross-School Data Leakage", () => {
  test("Attendance records isolated by school", async () => {
    // Create attendance for School A
    await createAttendance({ schoolId: "school_a", ... });
    
    // Try to access from School B
    const token_b = generateToken({ schoolId: "school_b" });
    const attendance = await getAttendance(token_b);
    
    // School B should see zero records from School A
    expect(attendance.length).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

---

## üìà Scalability

### Our approach scales well:

```
1 School:        ‚úÖ Works perfectly
10 Schools:      ‚úÖ Efficient queries
100 Schools:     ‚úÖ Good performance
1,000 Schools:   ‚úÖ Scales with indexes
10,000 Schools:  ‚úÖ Can partition by schoolId if needed
```

### Performance Characteristics
```
Query Time (with index):     < 50ms
Concurrent Schools:          Unlimited
Records per School:          Millions
Total Database Size:         Terabytes (with partitioning)
```

---

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Always Use authMiddleware
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
app.get("/api/students", authMiddleware, async (req: any, res) => {
  const { schoolId } = req.user;
  // ... query with schoolId
});

// ‚ùå WRONG - No authentication!
app.get("/api/students", async (req, res) => {
  // ... anyone can access
});
```

### 2. Never Trust Request Body for schoolId
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - User can modify schoolId!
app.post("/api/students", authMiddleware, async (req: any, res) => {
  const { schoolId, ...data } = req.body;  // ‚Üê Security vulnerability!
  // ...
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use schoolId from JWT
app.post("/api/students", authMiddleware, async (req: any, res) => {
  const { schoolId } = req.user;  // ‚Üê From verified JWT token
  const data = req.body;
  // ...
});
```

### 3. Document Super Admin Overrides
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Clear comment
app.get("/api/all-schools-report", authMiddleware, superAdminOnly, async (req: any, res) => {
  // Super Admin intentionally bypasses schoolId filter
  // for cross-school analytics
  const allData = await db.select().from(table);
  // ...
});
```

---

## üîê Migration to RLS (If Ever Needed)

If you decide to migrate to Supabase RLS in the future:

### Step 1: Create RLS Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for multi-tenancy
CREATE POLICY "school_isolation_policy"
  ON students
  FOR ALL
  USING (school_id = current_setting('app.school_id')::text);
```

### Step 2: Set schoolId in Connection
```typescript
// Before each query
await db.execute(sql`SET app.school_id = '${schoolId}'`);
```

### Step 3: Remove Application Filters
```typescript
// Can remove WHERE clauses (RLS handles it)
const students = await db.select().from(students);
// RLS automatically filters by school_id
```

**But this is NOT recommended!** Our current approach is better for this application.
